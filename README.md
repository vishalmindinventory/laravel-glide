This package provides an easy to use class to manipulate images. Under the hood it leverages [Glide](http://glide.thephpleague.com/) to perform 
the manipulations.

Here's an example of how the package can be used:

```php
GlideImage::create($pathToImage)
	->modify(['w'=> 50, 'filt'=>'greyscale'])
	->save($pathToWhereToSaveTheManipulatedImage);
```

## Installation

You can install the package through Composer.

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-glide
```

In Laravel 5.5 the service provider and facade will automatically get registered. In older versions of the framework just add the service provider and facade in `config/app.php` file:

```php
'providers' => [
    ...
    Spatie\Glide\GlideServiceProvider::class,
    ...
];

...

'aliases' => [
	...
    'GlideImage' => Spatie\Glide\GlideImageFacade::class,
    ...
]
```


You can publish the config file of the package using artisan.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Glide\GlideServiceProvider"
```

The config file looks like this:
```php

<?php

return [

    /*
     * The driver that will be used to create images. Can be set to gd or imagick.
     */
    'driver' => 'gd',
];

```
## Usage 

Here's a quick example that shows how an image can be modified:

```php
GlideImage::create($pathToImage)
	->modify(['w'=> 50, 'filt'=>'greyscale'])
	->save($pathToWhereToSaveTheManipulatedImage);
```

Take a look at [Glide's image API](http://glide.thephpleague.com/1.0/api/quick-reference/) to see which parameters you can pass to the `modify`-method.

## Testing

You can run the tests with:

```bash
composer test
```
